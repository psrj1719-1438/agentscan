# AgentScan

An open experiment in detecting automation patterns on GitHub


I didn’t expect to build this website, but ended up creating it in a weekend after reading [this article](https://socket.dev/blog/ai-agent-lands-prs-in-major-oss-projects-targets-maintainers-via-cold-outreach) about open source projects being targeted by AI agents.

**This is an ongoing experiment**. It uses an opinionated scoring system to analyze public GitHub events and classify accounts as human, suspicious, or likely bot.
The results are indicators, not verdicts. There’s no AI involved, just event analysis looking for patterns that feel a little off.

The stack is a straightforward Nuxt app with a single API endpoint that fetches public data from the GitHub API.
